            That's it mister! you just lost your brain priviliges! squidward...
            i used your clarinet to unclog my toilet! squidward, you're
            steaming. you're like a steamed vegetable, only smarter. you're a
            man now, spongebob, and it's time you started acting like one. the
            maniacs in the mailbox! squidward? squidward! the sky had a baby
            from my cereal box! can i have everybody's attention? i have to use
            the bathroom. if i were to die right now in a fiery explosion due to
            carelessness of a friend... . then it would just be alright. good
            people don't rip other people's arms off. insurance is what i need
            for a crabby patty. don't we look vicious and bloodthirsty? try one
            of those radioactive sludge balls you call food? next, i suppose
            you'll want me to go square-dancing with patrick! y'all better
            apologize, or i'll be on you like ugly on an ape. do instruments of
            torture count? it's an alaskan bull worm! i have a theory, people
            talk loud when they wanna act smart, right? either you (a) put the
            dime in me pants, (b) put the dime in me pants, or (c) put the dime
            in me pants! remember, licking doorknobs is illegal on other
            planets. that's no reason to be ripping people's heads off boy!
            holographic meatloaf? my favorite! excuse me sir? you're sitting on
            my face... which is also my body. oh, tartar sauce. spongebob is the
            only guy i know who can have fun with a jellyfish, for twelve hours!
            the line for the tunnel of glove is filling up. go out and get
            yourself a case of the krabbies. mr. krabs, please. i'll prove i'm a
            fry cook. ask squidward, he'll vouch for me. hey look, a cardboard
            box washed up on the beach. holy fish paste, it's a guy!!!
